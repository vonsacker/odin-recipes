    <h1>Lasagne</h1>
    <img src="/images/lasagne.webp" style="width: 400px" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made
      with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. It's excellent if you want to impress
      some guests — or even yourself. It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's
      well worth the TLC you put into it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pasta:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
      <li>⅝ cup semolina flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ragu:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

      <li>1 carrot, diced</li>

      <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>

      <li>1 onion, diced</li>

      <li>2 slices bacon, diced</li>

      <li>3 ½ ounces lean ground pork</li>

      <li>3 ½ ounces lean ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside. </li>
        <li>Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Cook pasta: Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into 3 portions. Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. Cook each pasta sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth. </li>
        <li> Finish ragu: Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. Cook for 1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the béchamel, 1/3 of the ricotta, and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining béchamel and Parmesan; dot with butter. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
